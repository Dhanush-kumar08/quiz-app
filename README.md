DOMAIN:FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT
DURATION:4 WEEKS
MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH
DESCRIPTION:As part of the Front-End Internship at CodTech, Task 1 involved developing an interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this task was to demonstrate the ability to create a user-facing application with real-time interactivity and logical flow using core web development technologies. The app was designed to allow users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback on their responses. Upon completing all questions, the user’s final score is displayed, giving a complete overview of their performance.

The task challenged my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and control flow. I began by designing the layout using HTML, creating a structured layout that included a question container, a list of answer buttons, a feedback section, and a “Next” button. Using semantic HTML ensured the structure was both accessible and easy to read. For styling, I used CSS to create a clean, user-friendly interface that would look good across different screen sizes. I applied responsive design principles such as flexible containers and media queries to ensure that the quiz was usable on both desktops and mobile devices.

The logic of the quiz was entirely handled by JavaScript. I stored all questions, options, and correct answers in an array of objects. Each time the user clicked the "Next" button, the script dynamically loaded the next question and options onto the page. When an answer option was clicked, JavaScript evaluated the selection against the correct answer and provided immediate feedback, visually highlighting whether the choice was correct or wrong. This not only improves user engagement but also reinforces learning as users progress through the quiz.

At the end of the quiz, the application calculates the total score and displays a completion message summarizing the user’s performance. This provided an opportunity to implement conditional logic and update the DOM in real time. One of the most valuable lessons from this task was how to separate structure (HTML), design (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) while maintaining a well-organized and readable codebase. I also ensured proper code commenting, which improves maintainability and demonstrates professionalism.

To meet the internship requirements, I uploaded the entire project to a GitHub repository with proper version control using Git. This included initializing a repository, committing changes, writing a meaningful commit message, and pushing the code to GitHub. I also included a README.md file with details about the project, technologies used, features, and folder structure, making the project easier to understand for others.

Overall, Task 1 was an excellent hands-on exercise to enhance my practical knowledge of front-end development. It allowed me to apply programming logic in a real-world context while also improving my problem-solving, debugging, and UI design skills. Completing this task gave me a strong foundation in JavaScript and made me more confident in building interactive web applications. It also demonstrated my ability to work independently and follow a project from concept to deployment, which are critical skills for any aspiring web developer
